		<h2>UNDER THE SEA!</h2>
		<p>The First site I visited was Under The Sea by Eric Stoltz.
		 I loved the old "antique-like" border on the bottom that stays in place as you scroll up and down.

		<h2>Zen City Morning</h2>
		<p>The Second site I visited was Zen City Morning by Ray Henrey.
		 I loved the clouds at the top of the page that stay in place as you scroll up and down.
		 I was wondering how he created that, It looks like he used

		 .extra1 : I  used the web developer plug in on Google Chrome to see it. If you go to View CSS scroll to the very bottom and it shows how the clouds were inserted
