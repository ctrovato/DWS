                    		<p>Florida’s diverse dive offerings run the gamut from fresh water to salt water and cave diving to drift diving. The state of Florida offers more shipwrecks than many countries! 
                    		   Florida pretty much has it all and the best part? You can dive it.
                    		   Diving is always an amazing experience. Whether you are just starting out or have 20 years of adventure behind you, it’s always fun. As long as you aren’t going to dive in a muddy lake. Featuring almost 1200 miles of coastline with clear blue water and wonderful weather, it’s no surprise that Florida is rated as one of the top scuba diving destinations in the world.

                        <p>Florida’s springs offer a range of fresh water diving - from deep cave diving done mainly by researchers and scientists at Wakulla florida cavern diversSprings to recreational cave diving. Here, you can go where few others have been. The Leon Sinks cave system near Tallahassee is a massive underwater cave system thought to be one of the most extensive in the world.
                           Ginnie Springs and Peacock Springs - some of the most visited freshwater dive spots in the world – are two spots you truly don’t want to miss. In caves and caverns, divers can find the occasional crayfish, catfish, eel or turtle.
